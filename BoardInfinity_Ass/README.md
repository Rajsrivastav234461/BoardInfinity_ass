# Kanban Board

This is a Kanban Board application built using **React.js**, **Firebase**, and **Lucide Icons**. It allows users to create, update, and manage tasks across different statuses like `TODO`, `IN PROGRESS`, and `COMPLETED`. Tasks can be prioritized, and users can set deadlines for each task.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks with a title, description, due date, priority, and status.
- **Task Status Management**: Change the status of tasks by dragging and dropping them between columns or by selecting a new status from a dropdown.
- **Task Priority**: Assign priorities such as `Low`, `Medium`, or `High` to tasks.
- **Task Editing**: Edit tasks to update the title, description, priority, and status.
- **Firebase Integration**: The app uses Firebase Firestore to store and persist tasks in a real-time database.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
